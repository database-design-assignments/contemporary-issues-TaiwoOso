# Contemporary Issues In Data
In this document, I discuss two articles on Google's "selling" of their user data and the concerns that many individuals have with the corporation's usage of their data and the benefits that Google says comes with their usage of this data.

# Does Google "Sell" your Data?

## Article 1
In Bennett Cypher's article, [Google Says It Doesn’t 'Sell' Your Data. Here’s How the Company Shares, Monetizes, and Exploits It.](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/google-says-it-doesnt-sell-your-data-heres-how-company-shares-monetizes-and), he talks about the various different methods Google uses in order to "bypass" the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) that regulates the sale of data and requires companies to provide users a choice on whether their data can be sold or not. Bennet describes two methods that Google uses to raise profits on their user data:

>Google monetizes what it observes about people in two major ways:
>
>It uses data to build individual profiles with demographics and interests, then lets advertisers target groups of people based on those traits.  
>It shares data with advertisers directly and asks them to bid on individual ads.

So basically, Google shares the user data they've collected with other companies and raise revenue by hosting advertisements from these companies that target specific users. This indirect way of "selling" user data allows Google in a sense to bypass the CCPA and continue raising their profits off user data like in previous years.

Personally, I have no issue with Google using my user data to raise revenue as I use Google on a day-to-day basis without ever "paying" for their services. However, I can see why people would have an issue with Google using their data in this way as it is a breach of privacy and it's been occuring for years without their knowledge. However, as people become more aware of these privacy issues, hopefuly we will see more stronger data privacy laws.

## Article 2
In Ben Popkin's aticle, [Google sells the future, powered by your personal data](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/google-sells-future-powered-your-personal-data-n870501), he discusses the pros and cons of Google's usage of their user data.

**Pros**  
The vast amount of user data that Google has allows them to create cool and helpful features that may help their users in their daily lives. For example, Ben says in his article that Google has been working on advanced technology such as an assistant that can schedule appointments for you over the phone and a new feature that helps users finish their sentences when composing emails. Google uses user data to develop features like these and imrpove pre-existing ones. They also use this information to provide their users relevant andvertisements and content.

**Cons**  
However, with the benefits that come with the user data Google has on us there are downsides that are quite concerning and that more people should be aware of. One concern that many users have is they don't know everything that Google is doing with their information. In Ben's article he mentions back in 2017 when Google said they would stop scanning emails in order to sell targeted advertisements. However, they later clarified later that they do still collect data from user emails and they just simply narrowed their uses for this data. So, who knows what else they're doing with our information or plan to do with it in the future? Another concern that many users have is the amount of information that Google actually has on their users. Ben says, "Dylan Curran, an information technology consultant, recently downloaded everything Facebook had on him and got a 600-megabyte file. When he downloaded the same kind of file from Google, it was 5.5 gigabytes, about nine times as large". Curran relates this to Google pretty much having cameras, trackers and microphones in our homes in return for just a few convenient features.

Now that I've seen more of the issues that many other people have with the user data that Google collects, I am a bit concerned on their collection of data especially just the vast amount in comparisson to other corporations. Going forward, I do plan to be more aware when using services by companies like Google and possibly clear my search and watch histories on a frequent basis.
